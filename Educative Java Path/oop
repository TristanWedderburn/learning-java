1. Inheritance
- child classes inherit all of the non-private methods and fields of the parent class
- inheritance helps us represent "is a" relationships
- can't inherit from a `final` class
- use `extend` 

Types of Inheritance:
- multi-level inheritance (derived from another class that is derived)
- multiple inheritance (derived from more than one parent class) and hybrid inheritance (multiple & multi-level combined)
    - in Java, multiple and hybrid inheritance are applicable only using interfaces

Advantages:
- re-usability
- avoid dupe code
- extensibility
- data hiding (make some data private so it cannot be altered by the derived class)

2. Polymorphism
3. Abstract Classes and Interfaces
4. Aggregation and Composition
